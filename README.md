artists_catalog Contao Extension
================================

The portfolio module is a simple way for artists and creatives to showcase their works with Contao. The extension can be used to easily add works with one or more images, description and title into your Online Portfolio. Every work can be categorized, using the build in Contao Site Structure as a taxonomy. The extension has three different frontend modules: portfolio reader, portfolio navigation and portfolio covers. The portfolio reader is used to display selected works from either the portfolio navigation or the portfolio covers. If all works should be displayed in only one category you can define a default page in the Contao Settings under portfolio settings.
